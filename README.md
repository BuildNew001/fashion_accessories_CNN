# fashion_accessories_CNN
# Overview
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of various fashion accessories. The dataset used for this project is the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images categorized into 10 different classes (labeled 0 to 9).
# Features
Dataset: Fashion MNIST, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
Preprocessing: Normalization and visualization of data.
Model Architecture: Custom CNN with multiple convolutional and dense layers.
Evaluation: Includes performance metrics such as accuracy and loss visualization
 # Structure of the Notebook
